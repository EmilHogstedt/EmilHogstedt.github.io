description: 
    - While working as a consultant at Blackdrop Interactive I worked at Svavelstickan, where I helped develop features for their upcoming game Star Fetchers.
    - During my time working on the project I contributed to everything from the engine, the physics system, gameplay programming, systems programming, game design and dialog writing.
    - A few notable contributions are; the basebuilding system, the Casino area within the game which I both designed and created from scratch, and the underlying hierarchical UI system used in many menus and gameplay features.
    - The game can be found on steam and kickstarter.
