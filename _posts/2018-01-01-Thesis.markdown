category: Master Thesis - Cooperative Modular Neural Networks for Artificial Intelligence in Games
description: 
    - My master thesis was written together with Ove Ødegård. Supervisor for the project was Ilir Jusufi and Co-supervisor was Svavelstickan AB.
    - In our thesis we explored a new way of thinking when it comes to using neural networks in games. Instead of using a singular neural network, tasked with achieving a goal, we used multiple modular neural networks cooperatively. The modular networks were in our case tasked with predicting the state of the game a certain amount of time into the future, such as the player position or how the terrain might look. The modular parts of the network are able to be re-used with other combinations of modular networks, reducing training time in the long run while increasing the network's performance at its task.
    - In the environment used for the project, the agent using the network is tasked with navigating a two-dimensional environment in the game Star Fetchers, which I have previously worked on and reference both in my CV and portfolio.
