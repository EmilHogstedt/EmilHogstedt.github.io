description: While working at Blackdrop Interactive I worked as a consultant with Svavelstickan AB, where I helped develop features for their upcoming game Star Fetchers. During my time in the project I helped with everything from the engine, the physics system, gameplay programming, systems programming, game design and dialog writing. A few notable contributions are the basebuilding system, the Casino area within the game which I both designed and created from scratch, and the underlying hierarchical UI system used in many menus and gameplay features.
