description: 
    - I am currently working at Pathos Interactive AB, where I contribute to our upcoming game "Hotel Architect" by designing, implementing, and testing gameplay related systems in C++.
    - The game is made in a custom version of Unreal Engine 5. Therefore, I also do some programming in Unreal Engine's blueprint system when needed. 
    - As Pathos Interactive is an indie game company, everyone has their say in the direction of the game. Thus, I have contributed to game design discussions and decisions during development.
languages: Unreal Engine 5 - C++
