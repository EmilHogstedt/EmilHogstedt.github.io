description: 
    - During my third year of studying; me and four other students made Solaris in 8 weeks during our Small Game Project course. Just like the Large Game Project, we made everything from scratch. Meaning we created our own game engine, using C++, and rendering pipeline using DirectX11.
    - Solaris is a Singleplayer Roguelike Spacesimulation game, where the aim is to visit the planets of the solar system to gather resources which are used to upgrade the player's ship. After progressing through the solar system the player is able to create the Warp Drive, which allows them to escape the solar system.
    - My focus of the project were the procedurally generated planets, which uses vertex offsetting in a Vertex Shader to offset points on a sphere. This, together with post-processing effects for the water and colors that depend on altitude and angle result in the planets seen in the videos. The amount of valleys, mountains, and oceans are also random.
    - Other than the procedural generation I also implemented part of the space-navigation and the gameplay systems surrounding the ship's upgrades and the planets' events that give the player resources.
languages: C++ - DirectX11 - HLSL
